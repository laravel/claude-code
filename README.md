# Laravel Agents & Skills

Laravel's official collection of agent skills, available as plugins for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) and [Cursor](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins).

## Installation

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add laravel/agent-skills
/plugin install laravel@laravel
/plugin install laravel-cloud@laravel
/plugin install laravel-nightwatch@laravel
/plugin install laravel-lsp@laravel
```

### Cursor

Search for **Laravel** in the [Cursor plugin marketplace](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins) panel and install the plugins you need.

### npx skills add

Install individual skills directly from this repository:

```sh
# Laravel Cloud
npx skills add https://github.com/laravel/agent-skills/tree/main/laravel-cloud/skills/deploying-laravel-cloud

# Laravel Nightwatch
npx skills add https://github.com/laravel/agent-skills/tree/main/laravel-nightwatch/skills/configure-nightwatch

# Starter Kit Upgrade
npx skills add https://github.com/laravel/agent-skills/tree/main/laravel/skills/starter-kit-upgrade
```

## Usage

**Laravel** invoke the agent after a coding session:

```
> Review recent changes using the laravel agent
```

**Laravel Cloud** triggers automatically when you ask about deploying or managing Laravel Cloud resources:

```
> Deploy my app to Laravel Cloud
> Set up a database and cache for the staging environment
```

**Laravel Nightwatch** triggers when you ask about configuring Nightwatch:

```
> Configure Nightwatch sampling rates for production
> Set up PII redaction for Nightwatch
```

**Starter Kit Upgrade** triggers when you ask to pull upstream improvements into a project bootstrapped from a Laravel starter kit:

```
> Sync the latest toast notification feature from the Vue starter kit
> Pull the 2FA autofocus fix from my starter kit upstream
```

**Laravel LSP** answers code navigation questions through the [Laravel language server](https://github.com/laravel/lsp):

```
> Where is the 'dashboard.index' view defined?
> What does config('services.stripe.key') resolve to?
```

## Plugins

### Laravel

A bundle of Laravel-focused agents and skills.

**`laravel-simplifier` agent** — Reviews recently modified PHP / Laravel code and refines it for clarity, consistency, and maintainability without changing functionality.

- Applies Laravel conventions and PSR-12 standards
- Reduces unnecessary complexity and nesting
- Improves naming and readability
- Focuses on recently modified code by default

**`starter-kit-upgrade` skill** — Selectively pulls upstream improvements from a Laravel starter kit (`vue-starter-kit`, `react-starter-kit`, `svelte-starter-kit`, `livewire-starter-kit`) into a project bootstrapped from one.

- Picks specific features (e.g. toast notifications, security fixes), not full version bumps
- Applies one feature at a time on a dedicated branch, each as its own commit
- Never auto-merges customized files or silently overwrites manifests / lockfiles
- Re-runs your tests, typecheck, and build to verify behavior preservation

### Laravel Cloud

A skill for deploying and managing applications on [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com) using the `cloud` CLI.

- Guides deployment workflows (first deploy, existing apps, environment setup)
- Manages infrastructure resources (databases, caches, domains, buckets)
- Includes operational checklists for multi-step tasks
- Follows the CRUD command patterns of the Cloud CLI

### Laravel Nightwatch

A skill for configuring [Laravel Nightwatch](https://nightwatch.laravel.com) data collection, sampling rates, filtering rules, and redaction policies. Bundles the [Nightwatch MCP server](https://nightwatch.laravel.com/docs/mcp-server) for browsing issues, viewing stack traces, updating statuses, and adding comments.

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| Setup & configuration | Guides Nightwatch setup in your application |
| Sampling & filtering | Manages data volume through sampling and filtering rules |
| PII redaction | Protects sensitive data with redaction policies |
| Event optimization | Optimizes event collection for production workloads |

### Laravel LSP

Registers the [Laravel language server](https://github.com/laravel/lsp) with Claude Code's LSP tool for `.php` and `.blade.php` files, so the agent resolves Laravel constructs through the language server instead of searching for them.

- Go-to-definition on views, routes, config keys, translations, and middleware aliases
- Hover shows resolved values: config settings, translated strings, bound implementations
- Works in both PHP and Blade files

Requires the language server: `composer global require laravel/lsp`, with Composer's global bin directory on your `PATH`. Claude Code runs one language server per file extension, so disable other PHP language server plugins when using this one.

The server detects Laravel at the workspace root. In a monorepo where the app lives in a subdirectory, add a project-level copy of this plugin's `.lsp.json` with `"workspaceFolder"` set to the app path (for example `"apps/api"`), and disable this plugin for that project.
